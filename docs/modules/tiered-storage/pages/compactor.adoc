= Compactor

The Tiered Storage compactor operates on each data partition to reclaim disk space by removing unused data.

When the configured threshold of available disk space is surpassed, compaction is initiated synchronously before and after a Map operation. To optimize the compaction process, the compactor compacts segments with the highest garbage ratio to reclaim disk space efficiently. During this process, live entries discovered by the compactor are moved to memory to allow the file to be discarded, this may temporarily reduce the efficiency of the hot cache.

The compactor can be fine-tuned by properties.
For information on the parameters, see xref:tiered-storage:configuration.adoc#fine-tuning[Fine-tuning].
