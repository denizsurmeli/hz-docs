= Managing and Monitoring the CP Subsystem
:page-aliases: cp-subsystem:listeners.adoc, cp-subsystem:member-shutdown.adoc
:description: The CP Subsystem requires manual intervention while expanding or shrinking its size, or when a CP member crashes or becomes unreachable. When a CP member becomes unreachable, it is not automatically removed from CP Subsystem because it could still be active and partitioned away.

{description}

== Tools

You can manage and monitor the CP Subsystem, using the following:

- Management Center
- Java member API
- REST interface
** REST endpoint URL
** `hz-cluster-cp-admin` shell
script, which comes with the Hazelcast package.
+
NOTE: The `hz-cluster-cp-admin` script uses the `curl` command, so `curl` must be installed to be able to use the script.

== Shutting Down CP Members

There is a significant behavioral difference during the CP member shutdown when CP
Subsystem Persistence is enabled and disabled.

When disabled (the default mode
in which CP Subsystem works only in memory), a shutting down CP member is
replaced with other available CP members in all of its CP groups in order not
to decrease or more importantly not to lose majorities of CP groups. It is
because CP members keep their local state only in memory when CP Subsystem
Persistence is disabled, hence a shut-down CP member cannot join back with its
CP identity and state, hence it is better to remove it from CP Subsystem not
to harm availability of CP groups. If there is no other available CP member to
replace a shutting down CP member in a CP group, that CP group's size is
reduced by 1 and its majority value is recalculated.

On the other hand, when CP
Subsystem Persistence is enabled, a shut-down CP member can come back by
restoring its CP state. Therefore, it is not automatically removed from CP
Subsystem when CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled. It is up to you to
remove shut-down CP members via
`CPSubsystemManagementService.removeCPMember(String)` if they will not come
back.

In summary, CP member shutdown behavior is as follows:

* When CP Subsystem Persistence is disabled (the default mode), shutting down
CP members are removed from CP Subsystem and the CP group majority values are
recalculated. You can shut down only `N-2` CP members at the same time. The remaining CP members must be shut down one at a time.
* When CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled, shutting down CP members are still
kept in CP Subsystem so they will be a part of the CP group majority calculations. You can shut down your CP members at the same time.

In case the persistence is disabled, if there are `N` CP members in CP
Subsystem, you can shut down `N-2` CP members
concurrently. Once these `N-2` CP members complete their shutdown,
the remaining CP members must be shut down one at a time. Even though
the shutdown API can be called concurrently on multiple members, _the METADATA
CP_ group handles shutdown requests serially. Therefore, it would be simpler to
shut down CP members one by one, by calling `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()` on
the next CP member once the current CP member completes its shutdown.

The above rule does not apply when CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled; you can shut down
your CP members concurrently. It is enough for users to recall this rule while shutting down CP members when CP
Subsystem Persistence is disabled.

If interested, you can read the rest of this paragraph to learn the reasoning behind this rule:
Each shutdown request
internally requires a Raft commit to _the METADATA CP group_ when CP Subsystem
Persistence is disabled. A CP member proceeds to shutdown after it receives
a response of this commit. To be able to perform a Raft commit, _the METADATA
CP group_ must have its majority up and running. When only 2 CP members are
left after graceful shutdowns, the majority of _the METADATA CP group_ becomes
2. If the last 2 CP members shut down concurrently, one of them is likely to
perform its Raft commit faster than the other one and leave the cluster before
the other CP member completes its Raft commit. In this case, the last CP member
waits for a response of its commit attempt on _the METADATA CP group_, and
times out eventually. This situation causes an unnecessary delay on the shutdown
process of the last CP member. On the other hand, when the last 2 CP members
shut down serially, the ``N-1``th member receives the response of its commit
after its shutdown request is committed also on the last CP member. Then,
the last CP member checks its local data to notice that it is the last CP
member alive, and proceeds its shutdown without attempting a Raft commit on
_the METADATA CP group_.

See <<cp-membership-listeners, CP Membership Listeners>> to get notified
about the CP member additions and removals. See also xref:maintain-cluster:shutdown.adoc#shutting-down-a-hazelcast-member[Shutting Down a Hazelcast Member] for a general information on shutting down specific members and considerations to take into account.

== Handling a Lost Majority

When the majority of a CP group is lost, that CP group cannot make
progress anymore. New CP members cannot even join a CP group that has lost majority because membership changes must also go through the Raft consensus algorithm.

* If the group is not the `METADATA` CP group, it must be <<destroy-group, force-destroyed>> immediately, because it can block the `METADATA` CP group from performing membership changes on the CP Subsystem.
* If the majority of the `METADATA` CP group permanently crashes, it is equivalent to the permanent crash of the whole CP Subsystem, even though other CP groups are running fine. In this case, you must <<reset, reset the CP Subsystem>>.

== Listening for Events

The CP Subsystem provides the following listeners:

* CP membership listeners
* CP group availability listeners

=== CP Membership Listeners

`CPMembershipListener` is notified when a CP member is added to or removed
from the CP Subsystem.

The listener interface has methods that are invoked for the following events:

* `memberAdded`: A new CP member is added to the CP subsystem.
* `memberRemoved`: An existing CP member is removed from the CP subsystem.

To get notified for CP membership events, implement the `CPMembershipListener` interface.

The following is an example `CPMembershipListener` class:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/cp/event/CPMembershipListenerImpl.java[tag=impl]
----

`CPMembershipListener` can be defined in the configuration or can be registered
at runtime with the `CPSubsystem` API.

Below is an example registering the listener at runtime, using the `CPSubsystem.addMembershipListener()` method:

[source,java]
----
// Either server or client
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = ...;
hazelcastInstance.getCPSubsystem().addMembershipListener(new CPMembershipListenerImpl());

=== CP Group Availability Listeners

`CPGroupAvailabilityListener` is notified when the availability of a CP group decreases
or it loses the majority completely.

In general, the availability decreases when a CP member becomes unreachable because of a process crash,
network partition, out-of-memory error or upon a graceful shutdown. Once a member is declared unavailable
by the failure detector, that member is removed from the cluster.
If it is also a CP member, a `CPGroupAvailabilityEvent` is fired for each CP group that member belongs to.

`CPGroupAvailabilityListener` has a separate method to report
the loss of majority.

The listener interface has methods that are invoked for the following events:

* `availabilityDecreased`: A CP group's availability decreases,
but still has the majority of members available.
* `majorityLost`: A CP group has lost its majority.

The following is an example `CPGroupAvailabilityListener` class:

[source,java]
----

A `CPGroupAvailabilityListener` can be defined

== Creating CP Groups

To create a custom CP group, add an `@` symbol to the end of the data structures name, followed by the name of the group that you want to create and store the data structure in. For example, here, a new CP group is created with the name `myGroup` and then an atomic long called `myAtomicLong` is initialized in this custom CP group: `.getAtomicLong("myAtomicLong@myGroup")`.

If you use fenced locks or semaphores, we recommend using a minimal number of CP groups. For these data structures, a Hazelcast member or client starts
a new xref:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc#sessions[session] on the corresponding CP group when it makes its very first acquisition request, and then periodically commits session heartbeats
to this CP group in order to indicate its liveliness. If fenced
locks and semaphores are distributed to multiple CP groups, there will be
a session management overhead on each CP group. Therefore, for most use
cases, the `DEFAULT` CP group should be sufficient to maintain all CP data
structure instances. Custom CP groups is recommended only when you benchmark
your deployment and decide that performance of the `DEFAULT` CP group is not
sufficient for your workload.

== Destroying a CP Group by Force

You can destroy the given active CP group without using the Raft
algorithm mechanics. This method must be used only when a CP group loses its
majority and cannot make progress anymore. Normally, membership changes in CP
groups, such as CP member promotion or removal, are done via the Raft consensus
algorithm. However, when a CP group permanently loses its majority, it will not
be able to commit any new operation. Therefore, this method ungracefully
terminates the remaining members of the given CP group on the remaining CP
group members. It also performs a Raft commit to the `METADATA` CP group in
order to update the status of the destroyed group. Once a CP group is
destroyed, all CP data structure proxies created before the destroy fails
with `CPGroupDestroyedException`. However, if a new proxy is created
afterwards, then this CP group is re-created from scratch with a new set of CP
members.

This method is idempotent. It has no effect if the given CP group is already
destroyed.

== Removing a CP Member

You can remove a given CP member from the active CP members list and all
CP groups it belongs to. If any other active CP member is available, it
replaces the removed CP member in its CP groups. Otherwise, CP groups of which
the removed CP member is a member shrinks and their majority values are
recalculated.

WARNING: Before removing a CP member from the CP Subsystem, make sure that it is declared as unreachable by the failure detector and removed from
the member list. The behavior is undefined when a running CP member is removed from the CP Subsystem.

== Promoting a Local Member to a CP Member

A new CP member can be added to the CP Subsystem to either increase the number of
available CP members for new CP groups or to fill the missing slots in existing
CP groups. After the initial Hazelcast cluster startup is done, an existing
Hazelcast member can be promoted to the CP member role. This new CP member
automatically joins to CP groups that have missing members, and majority values
of these CP groups are recalculated.

If the local member is already a CP member,
this method has no effect.

The promoted CP member will be
added to the CP groups that have missing members. A group that is missing members is one where the current size of the group is smaller than the configured xref:configuration.adoc#group-size[`group-size`].

[NOTE]
====
When a member becomes a CP member, it generates an additional UUID that other CP members can use to identify it. You will see this CP UUID in the following places:

- Requests to REST endpoints in the CP group
- Responses from REST endpoints in the CP group
- Member logs
- Management Center

== Wiping and Resetting the CP Subsystem

You must wipe and reset the whole CP Subsystem state only when the `METADATA` CP group loses its majority and cannot make progress
anymore.

After this method is called, all CP state and data are wiped, including data written by CP Subsystem Persistence, and CP members
start with empty state.

This method can be invoked only from the Hazelcast master member, which is
the first member in the Hazelcast cluster member list. Moreover, the Hazelcast
cluster must have at least the number of members configured in the xref:configuration.adoc#cp-member-count[`cp-member-count`] option.

This method must not be called while there are membership changes in
the Hazelcast cluster. Before calling this method, make sure that there
is no new member joining and all existing Hazelcast members have seen the same member list.

This method triggers a new CP discovery process round. However, if the new CP
discovery round fails for any reason, Hazelcast members are not terminated,
because Hazelcast members are likely to contain data for AP data structures
and their termination can cause data loss. Hence, you need to observe
the cluster and check if the CP discovery process completes successfully.

WARNING: This method is **NOT** idempotent and multiple invocations can break
the whole system. After calling this API, you must observe the system to see if
the reset process is successfully completed or failed before making another
call.

== Forcing a Session to Close

If a Hazelcast instance that owns a CP session crashes, its CP session is not
terminated immediately. Instead, the session is closed after
the configured xref:configuration.adoc#session-time-to-live-seconds[`session-time-to-live-seconds`] passes. If it is known for
sure that the session owner is not partitioned and definitely crashed, this
method can be used for closing the session and releasing its resources
immediately.
