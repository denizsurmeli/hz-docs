= Mapping to JDBC
:description: To query external JDBC data stores, you can create a mapping to them with the JDBC connector.

{description}

== What is the JDBC Connector

The JDBC connector allows you to connect to any database that supports the JDBC interface.

== Supported Databases

The JDBC connector supports the following database management systems:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle

NOTE: You can use other database management systems with a JDBC interface. However, Hazelcast offers no guarantees or support for these systems.

NOTE: If your table and column names include lower case characters, you must enclose the names in double quotes to prevent Oracle converting the names to upper case. If you do not enclose the table and column names in double quotes, use upper case when referring to them, for example, in Hazelcast mapping.

== Supported SQL Statements

The JDBC connector supports only the following statements:

- xref:select.adoc[`SELECT`]
- xref:sink-into.adoc[`INSERT INTO`]
- xref:update.adoc[`UPDATE`]
- xref:delete.adoc[`DELETE`]





== Installing the Connector

The JDBC connector is included in the full and slim distributions of Hazelcast.

== Permissions
[.enterprise]*Enterprise*

The JDBC connector does not yet support permissions.

== Before you Begin

Before you can create a mapping to an external data store, you must have the following:

- A JDBC driver that's compatible with your data store. This driver must be on the classpath of your cluster members:
** The full distribution of  Hazelcast Enterprise comes with a JDBC driver for PostgreSQL data stores only.
** The slim distribution of Hazelcast does not come with a JDBC driver.
** The full distribution of Hazelcast Open Source comes with a JDBC driver for MySQL and PostgreSQL data stores.
- A xref:external-data-stores:external-data-stores.adoc[data store connection] that's configured on all cluster members.
- Create the database that you'll use as your external data store.

== Creating a JDBC Mapping

The following example creates a mapping to a MySQL database.

In the MySQL database, create a `people` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100))
```

Use the `CREATE MAPPING` statement to tell the JDBC connector the name of your data store configuration.

```yaml
external-data-store:
  mysql-database: <1>
    class-name: com.hazelcast.datastore.JdbcDataStoreFactory
    properties:
      jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://dummy:3306
      username: xyz
      password: xyz
    shared: true
```
<1> Configuration details for a MySQL database.

Create the mapping.

```sql
CREATE MAPPING people
TYPE JDBC <1>
OPTIONS ( 
  'externalDataStoreRef'='mysql-database' <2>
)
```

<1> The name of the connector.
<2> The name of the external data store configuration on your members.

== Data Type Mapping Between Hazelcast and MySQL
Hazelcast supports a subset of SQL data types. For MySQL data types, see the https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html[official MySQL documentation]. The following MySQL types are mapped to the respective Hazelcast SQL type:

== Data Type Mapping Between Hazelcast and Oracle
For Oracle data types see the https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Data-Types.html#GUID-7B72E154-677A-4342-A1EA-C74C1EA928E6[official Oracle documentation]. The following Oracle types are mapped to the respective Hazelcast SQL type.
`NUMBER(p,s)` represents a NUMBER type with a decimal precision of `p` and a scale of `s` that is greater than 0. `NUMBER(p)` has a scale of 0.


[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Oracle Type| Hazelcast SQL Type
